5. a) Explain the navigational mesh for AI in Unity with any two features. [3 pts] 

	The Navigational mesh for AI in Unity is a data structure used for AI pathfinding. It defines walkable areas and obstacles in a 3D environment. It automatically handles pathfinding, movement, and obstacle avoidance. One of the features, obstacle avoidance, adjusts movement to avoid dynamic and static obstacles; moreover, objects are set to "static" to indicate they will not move allowing other gameObjects controlled by AI to move around them freely. A second feature is Stopping Distance which defines how close an agent will get to its target before stopping. For example, Stopping Distance can be used to ensure that the enemy stops and attacks the player from a certain distance instead of pushing the player.
